# Agent Instructions

Create a new folder for your investigation with an appropriate name.

Create a `notes.md` file in that folder and use it to track what you tried and anything you learned along the way.

When you are ready to make your final commit, it should include:

- Your `notes.md` file
- A `README.md` summarizing your findings
- Any original code you wrote as part of your investigation
- `git diff` output from any changes you made to existing code - do NOT include full copies of code that you fetched as part of your investigation
- Any binary files under 2MB that are relevant to your investigation

Do NOT include full copies of code that you fetched as part of your investigation. Only include the code you wrote yourself, or git diffs of changes you made to existing code.

Do not include full clones of Git repositories.
